# eve-online-cmd-batch-copy-character-settings
A Batch script to copy your character settings to all your Tranquility characters.

Put this file on Desktop.

Exit EVE Online and run this batch script to update all your characters with the latest settings.

Note! If your last character wasn't a main character, you will overwrite all or characters with alt settings. Don't worry. A backup directory will exist in Settings. Backup will be overwritten on each consecutive run though.
